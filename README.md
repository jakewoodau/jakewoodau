### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My current role is the Product Lead at etrainu. My focus is on creating a world-class learning management system that caters to our international customer base. My passion for crafting product development processes ensures that we're always moving quickly and building the right solutions. With previous experience at WorkingMouse, Codebots, and Gravit Designer, I have a diverse background in product, design, management, and development that allows me to bring a well-rounded perspective to my work. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging technology to tackle complex problems and create innovative solutions alongside users.

When I'm not working, you can find me on the golf course, tackling DIY projects at home, or exploring the latest and greatest restaurants in town. I stay on top of industry trends by following influential leaders in technology, product, and venture capital and consuming podcasts and audiobooks on topics related to product, technology, and strategy.
