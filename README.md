### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm the Product Lead at etrainu, where I'm dedicated to creating a world-class learning management system that caters to our international customer base. In addition to this, I'm highly focused on optimising our product development process to ensure that we're moving quickly and building the right solutions. With experience in product, design, management, and development - my diverse background allows me to bring a well-rounded perspective to my work. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging technology to tackle complex problems and create innovative solutions alongside users. When I'm not working, you can catch me on the golf course, tackling DIY projects at home, or exploring the latest and greatest restaurants in town. To stay on top of industry trends, I follow influential leaders in technology, product, and venture capital, and I'm an avid consumer of podcasts and audiobooks on topics related to product development, technology, and process improvement.
